title: "Tay's top 25 albums of 2022"
---

Below I detail my favorite albums of this year in descending order.

There is also an accompanying [songs](songs.html) list too.

```{r list, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
albums <- read.csv("album_list.csv")
lower_albums <- albums[25:11,]
upper_albums <- albums[10:1,]
row.names(lower_albums) <- paste0("**", 25:11, "**")
#lower_albums$image <- paste0('![](img/', lower_albums$File.Name, ')')
lower_albums$image <- paste0('<img src=img/alb/', lower_albums$File.Name, ' width="330"/>')
lower_albums <- lower_albums[,c(1, 2, 4)]
colnames(lower_albums) <- c("Album Title", "Artist", NULL)
knitr::kable(lower_albums, col.names = c("Album Title", "Artist", ""), format = "html", escape = F) %>%
  kable_styling(font_size = 20, position = "left", full_width = TRUE)
```

And now, for the top 10 albums, who are deserving of opinions.

## 10. The Beths - Expert in a Dying Field

Fish album fish album fish album. What sets this album apart from previous offerings from The Beths is a cohesion in the album, one of my favorite traits. The guitars drive and weave to create a distortive soundscape, while Elizabeth's clear vocals lament love and ponder the albums big question throughout the 12 songs.

## 9. Nilüfer Yanya - PAINLESS

Nilüfer Yanya's first full-length since the more conceptual *Miss Universe*, _PAINLESS_ deals more in breakneck beats, soft vocals, and stripped-back instrumentals to concise effect.

## 8. Beach House - Once Twice Melody
<center>
<img src=img/alb/beach.jpeg width="65%"/>
I'll take this moment to acknowledge a glaring omission, Big Thief's 2022 release did not make my list. This is because _Once Twice Melody_ is simply the better indie double album that came out in February by celebrated mainstays of the genre. They are both separate and great, and basically occupy the same space in my mind.  

But Beach House is a little better so it gets to be on the website.

There is no time for honorable mentions, but if I didn't put down an album **you** really liked, consider it my top honorable mention. 

If you haven't yet, please enjoy my list on this year's [songs](songs.html) or my silly little [superlatives](superlatives.html). There is a playlist for the songs as well:
